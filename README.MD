# Generate PDF with React

In this project I wrote code that allows us to generate PDFs with reactJS.

There are actually 2 subprojects in this repo. The first generates a medical report to be sent to a patient while the 2nd generates a report to be sent to a doctor.

This is an extract from a hospital project I did a while back.

The patient report shows the report on both web and a pdf.

### Running patient report

- cd patient-report
- yarn install
- yarn start
- To view pdf go to http://localhost:3000/pdf
- To view web page report go to http://localhost:3000

### Running doctor

- cd doctor-pdf
- yarn install
- yarn start
- To view report go to http://localhost:3000
